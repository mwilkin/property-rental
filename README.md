# Property-rentals | Ember JS

* A simple application that allows property owners to list places for rent, and where renters to search for places to stay [similar to AirBnB or Vacasa].

### User Stories

* User can see a list of potential rental with their inherent properties.
* User can see an image of the rental and hide it again.
* User can delete a rental from the list
* User can add a rental to a list.

### Further Exploration
* Create a new model called Announcement that will allow the site administrator to add important messages for users (upcoming sales, weather warnings, and other big exciting news).
* Allow administrators to add and delete announcements. (We are not adding user authentication, so technically the admins and users can see the same information, that's fine for now!)
* Add a button or link on the main page for users to visit these "Important announcements".
